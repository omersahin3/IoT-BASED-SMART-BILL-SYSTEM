In a world where unconscious consumers are concentrated, our energy consumption is increasing. This thesis has been prepared by taking the continuity of electricity, natural gas and water resources for raising awareness of people in the foreground. The natural gas, water and electricity bills we use in our homes are spent without knowing what will happen by the end of the month and after the invoice is received, it is decided to decrease or increase the usage next month. We know that we keep the electricity consumed by the consumer every hour and the water and natural gas bills they use every day in our database. We can notify the user by e-mail about the electricity bill every 6 hours and the water and natural gas bill every 24 hours. Before running the program, the user determines a price range according to her own budget and when she passes that interval, the user is sent an emergency mail. We provide visual graphics to the user with the help of grafana with the information we keep in our database, providing easy use and awareness to the user.
